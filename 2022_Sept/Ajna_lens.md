## **The experience**

My timing couldn’t have been better when I joined as a Unity Developer intern at AjnaLens. The organization was in the midst of developing a better-mixed reality headset and was experimenting with other products on the market. So I got to experience all the latest VR headsets. I don’t know anyone in my class who can boast that they went to their office to **play “Beat Saber”** multiple times so that **“they can better understand the working of the device”.**

The project I was given was to create a **‘digital twin’** of a robot and its real environment. This **‘digital twin’** is a complete one-to-one scaled model of the actual scenario in the virtual world. The idea is that one could control the virtual robot, which would be reflected in a change in position of the robot at a remote location. In the process, I got work on a mini-robot arm. I set a client-server system to transmit the data over the network, facilitating the data transfer needed to send the position value to the real robot. The team I worked with couldn’t have been any better. Most of my colleagues were a few years older than me. I did not feel out of place at all. In fact, I would look forward to going to the office to meet up and work with all of them.

As this was a peak work time at the company, they organized events for respite. As luck would have it, a week after I joined, a bowling party was organized. I had a great time at the mall’s bowling alley.

The office organized a yoga session on World Yoga Day, which **I skipped** as I had an **“unfortunate attack of the motions”**. The HR saw through my lie but played along. Little did I know what was coming next. He made me confirm that I was free on a Saturday but kept the actual reason a secret. He did make hints of the event being a grand one. I came to the event’s location with great expectations – of a food party or a gaming session on the day. To my surprise, everyone was gathered at what seemed to be a foothill of a hill. **To my shock**, my HR handed me a potted plant, pointed at the mountain and told me that it would be planted at the top of the hill. **I was dragged into going on the trek.** At the end of the day, I barely made it home. However, the climb gave a sense of achievement, and the view at the top was breathtaking.

AjnaLens is deeply into spirituality, and I immersed myself in it. I participated in the daily morning bhajan sessions at 9.30 A.M. There were meditation sessions. Every major undertaking was done with the blessings of the divine.

It was a great experience working at AjnaLens. It is a small company, where everyone knows one another intimately, making it one big family. I was happy to be a part of such a wonderful organization.
