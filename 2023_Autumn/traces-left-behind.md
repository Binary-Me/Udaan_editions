<!--StartFragment-->



With no shortcuts to any places

Letting nature choose mine cycle's traces

From destining my course through many villages

Something strengthened me to touch higher edges

You gave me courage

to track down woody mazes



My legs shivered, mine heart was pounding

Hey, the dopamine was way too exciting

Me soaking shirt you serine solace

My brimming emotions all relaxed



Rush, rush, the time comes short

Oh my friend, what about reaching home

Waving away this sacred space

Sprinting towards ending this phase
