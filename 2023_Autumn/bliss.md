In the winter, when the world is frozen,

and stray animals cuddle in packs of a dozen,

make yourself a cup of steaming tea,

and watch your life unfold its beauty.





In the summer, when the world is boiling,

and the animals in search of water are toiling,

find yourself wading through a beach with glee,

eternal bliss, my man, demands no fee.





In the spring, when new leaves are blooming,

and the animals are jolly - alive and stirring,

lose yourself in nature’s quietude,

learn to find bliss in holistic solitude.





In the autumn, when the leaves finally fall,

when animals stock food, and respond to nature’s call,

stroll through a forest, and hear the leaves crackle,

when the mind is happy, any problem you shall tackle
