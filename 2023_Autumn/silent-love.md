<!--StartFragment-->

Youngsters from across the country

From backgrounds different too

Different language each one speaks

But all I see is you



Your eyes, twin galaxies of endless depth

Hold secrets and stories untold

A mystical pool where emotions ebb

With each glance, an adventure unfolds



Your laughter, like a melody divine

Rings within the chambers of my soul

Its rhythm, like the symphony of time

Enchants my heart, making it whole



My admiration blooms and grows

Though silent like a fox in the forest

A silent witness to her mystery

A love that in my heart shall rest
