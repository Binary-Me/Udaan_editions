<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">
Buses come and leave,<br>                    
Passengers board and alight,<br>                    
Few wait and some leave, <br>  
All-day long, at the site,  <br> 
One sits with beliefs,  <br> 
A Bus that took his light, <br>  
Took the rose, left the leaves,<br>    
And thorns with blight,  <br> 
Waits for the bus of thieves,  <br> 
Who stole away all his delight. <br>  
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">
Some saw and perceived,  <br> 
An idler sitting in vain,  <br> 
Some blessed, few curses received,  <br> 
Still there sits, clothes with stains,<br>   
A beggar, some believed,   <br> 
But he awaits hate's bane,  <br> 
With what everyone is weaved,  <br> 
He waits for a dream, as it rains,  <br>  
And the bus has arrived,  <br> 
While he falls for her again.   <br>
