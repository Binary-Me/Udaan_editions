### **Fiesta**
This year, the Intra-IIT Cultural and Literary fest was named *'Fiesta'* and was held in two phases, online and offline. Students were first divided into houses based on their branches, and WhatsApp groups were formed. The houses were then given their first task, to give themselves a name along the lines of this year’s theme, _Mythology_. The houses came up with the names *Airavat, Ekalavya, Garuda, Brahmastra, and Thunder Phoenix*. All the cultural and literary clubs hosted a plethora of contests for the teams to participate in and started sending out mails announcing the details. The online phase of Fiesta commenced in March and saw astounding participation from every house. There was fierce competition to grab the trophy. The offline events started in full vigour right after Tirutsava 2k22. The campus was once again a buzz of activity with students actively participating and giving these events their all. The grand finale to Fiesta came with the much anticipated Ethnic Night. On the fine evening of 24th April, a colourful crowd all dressed in traditional attire from various parts of the country, made its way to the OAT for the Ethnic night celebrations and stage events of Fiesta. As part of the Ethnic night celebrations, a dazzling fashion show and a mesmerising talent showcase were conducted. Finales of contests like *Vibrato, Concerto, Rhythm*, etc were also held on stage for everyone to witness. The grand celebrations came to an end with a DJ night which served as an opportunity for students to dance their hearts out and celebrate.

### **Kridan**
The Intra-IIT Sports meet was given a name for the first time this year. The name *Kridan* is a blend of the words *Kreda* and *Maidan*. All the students of our campus were divided into four teams namely *Radiants, Shershaahs, House of Warriors, and The Arsenal*. Team leaders were selected and respective WhatsApp groups were formed for further information exchange. Once the teams were formed, the Intra-IIT Sports meet was launched on the 11th of April. Online fitness challenges were conducted which were met with enthusiastic participation. For the offline sports contests, team selections were held which saw tough competition, and with the students’ return to campus, offline events and competitions were kicked off. Team fixtures and order of tournaments were released and *Kridan* was off to an energetic start. For the first time, team jerseys were designed and provided for all the competing students to invoke team spirit and motivation. *Kridan* was a huge success with students rushing around the campus in their respective team jerseys, actively participating in tournaments to lead their house to victory. The month long sports tournament left a lasting impact on all our minds. The offline tournaments were also enjoyed by patriotic crowds cheering for their teams to win. The prizes for all the tournaments were later distributed on the Gymkhana day along with the trophy for the winning team.

### **GCU**
The Guidance and Counselling Unit of IITT, Sarathi, has been keeping up the good work of ensuring that students are healthy physically and mentally. They have ensured that help will always be provided for whoever reaches out. In the previous academic year, Sarathi has continued conducting in-person counselling sessions on a regular basis, while ensuring the confidentiality of those who availed these sessions. On top of this, an exclusive room for Sarathi was set up in the basement of F Block for the conduction of in-person counselling sessions. Since not everyone who needs help actually reaches out, Sarathi also took help from the Faculty advisors and the Student Body to identify those who needed help and arranged counselling sessions for those who agreed to attend. A webinar on **‘Empower Your Inner Self’**, and a webinar on **‘A Guide to Suicide Prevention’** were also conducted which saw active participation, including that of the the Director, IITT. For the faculties of our institute, a barefoot counselling session was held in collaboration with YourDost.                                  

Sarathi reached a milestone in their development with the official launch of their [website](https://iittp.ac.in/gcu/) on December 17, 2021. Once the new set of students joined the institute, GCU IITT allotted **UG Buddies** with the aim of improving communications between seniors and juniors and for the seniors to guide their juniors through transitioning into college life. Another milestone in the development of Sarathi was achieved in January 2022 with the launch of the official youtube channel and Instagram page to improve their online presence and reach. GCU posters were designed as a guide for students to seek help when they need it and these were attached all around the campus. Sarathi also hosted three talks by distinguished experts and speakers of mental health in addition to three talks in collaboration with YourDost. All of these events saw enthusiastic participation from students who wanted to focus on self-improvement.

### **Tirutsava**
After _lots_ of uncertainty, rescheduling and discussion, our very own techno-cultural fest **'Tirutsava'** kick-started in Jan 2022. The grand fest was conducted in three phases namely *'The Inception', 'The Avenue' and 'The Conclusion'*. All the committees were formed and pumped up to put on a great show which they did deliver. **The Inception** started around 22nd January 2022 and went on till 26th February 2022. It had many exciting events such as *BGMI, Freefire, Competitive Coding, Insta Hunt*, and lots more. In collaboration with Sargam, a workshop on *'Introduction to music theory*' was conducted. As a part of the second phase, **The Avenue**, competitions on some trending games which include *COD, Volarant*, etc. were held with enthusiastic participation from students all across the country. 
                              
Where’s the fun in an online fest? With the grace of covid and the covid committee, the gateway to conduct an offline fest opened. It was decided that the third phase, **The Conclusion**, would be conducted offline. The dates were fixed to be 15th April 2022 to 17th April 2022 and invitations were sent out to selected colleges (limited of course due to covid restrictions). *‘Garuda’* was chosen to be the mascot of this year’s fest.                  
                                           
With the fest just about the corner, the groundwork for most of the committees began with full vigour. The campus was a buzz of activity as people from various committees did their best to ensure the smooth conduction of the fest. As a promotional and marketing strategy, flash mobs were conducted in several locations around Tirupati city. The much-awaited official Tirutsava merchandise went up for sale on the website. The Creative Cell worked day and night to make sure the campus was beautifully decorated and looked festive. They came up with different themes to decorate the campus for the big event which turned out to be a centre of attraction. As the fest drew even closer, the work of the Hospitality committee and the Security and Logistics committee began. The day before the fest was very hectic as all committees tried to ensure everything was in place for the big event. The very air was filled with festive vibes and anticipation.
                             
The much-awaited Day 1 of Tirutsava 2022 started off with many cultural events including *Expressivo, Enigma, Funky Feet*, and Tech events such as the *App Development contest and Web Development contest* which saw active participation.

On the second day, events such as *Squid Games, JAM, Ideathon, and Treasure Hunt* took place with much energy and zeal.

The last and the final day witnessed events such as *Robosphera, Crime Busters, Talky Jockey*, and many more. Apart from these events, *Data Science and Ethical Hacking* workshops were conducted. The fest came to an end on a very high note.

The fest proved to be an amazing and memorable experience. Despite being hybrid, Tirutsava 2022 proved to be a grand success. Many of the students got a chance to understand how things needed to be dealt with as they got a chance to work being part of various committees. With all the technical, cultural, and literary events, students got a chance to explore their talents and interests.

<a id="have-we-met-before"></a>
### Have we met before   
When it comes to memories, the fleeting moments spent with friends be it randomly bumping into each other at 2 am, or standing in long lines in the mess, fighting for ice cream in the canteen, the two-minute conversations that lead into deep conversations, and so on, are the ones that stand out. But when the college was nothing but the four walls of your room and a laptop screen, how does one make these memories? How does one interact with their college mates? The LAC and GCU came together to address this issue and organised *"Have We Met Before?*” - an institute-wide interactive and fun event, open to all UG and PG students where students across branches, and years came together to participate in a variety of activities.                                           

The planning for this event, which was held on the 4th of July, began weeks before the event. The organisation of the event involved the entire team of the LAC along with volunteers from the GCU. The team planned out various activities. Over 150 students registered for the event, who were then divided into teams with a mix of PG and UG students, across the years. A discord server was created to host the event. Volunteers to conduct the event were briefed about the process of the event, and test runs were conducted. On the day of the event, the organisers and the volunteers saw tremendous participation from all the students who had registered. The event was held in two sessions in morning and afternoon, for efficient management from the organisers’ side. The event received an overwhelmingly positive response and feedback. True to its aim, “Have We Met Before” brought together students from different parts of their college journey and formed bonds and friendships that continue to this date. Despite the online restrictions, students were able to go from ‘Have we met before?’ to ‘Yes, we have met before’, and got a glimpse of what offline social interactions in college would look like.

<a id="signature-day"></a>
### **Signature Day**   
College days are the most memorable days when people find friends who would come with them in all walks of life. To acknowledge all those friendships, on December 20th, a Signature day event was conducted for all the graduating students where they were given white shirts and some paints to leave a message to their pals. All the students gathered in the OAT and had some fun-filled memories which they will look back at with a smile on their faces.

<a id="trek-to-tada-waterfalls"></a>
### **Trek to Tada Waterfalls**  
With all the student activities getting back on track, the Aranya club came back organising a trek to the Tada waterfalls. This was a special one as it was the first-ever trek for a few and last-ever for a few here at college. The day started pretty early with students getting trek ready with much enthusiasm early in the morning. All the students boarded their buses and were enjoying themselves with fun conversations and music. As soon as everybody reached the destination, refreshments were distributed. With full energy and enthusiasm, all the students took off to begin their trek. It was pretty smooth in the beginning but got challenging soon. Eventually, just like the light at the end of the tunnel, the struggle came to an end and everybody got to refresh themselves as they reached the waterfall. The tiring trek was proof to the saying *‘You can't enjoy the view if you don't climb the mountain’*. Students had fun swimming in the water, splashing water on their friends, clicking pictures, and pulling each other’s legs. After having a small refreshing dip, it was time to head back to the buses. Lunch was served, after which, everybody returned to campus. It was truly a remarkable and fun experience.

### **Elections**
Student representatives play an important role in influencing the atmosphere of the campus. As the tenure of the secretaries almost came to an end, elections were round the corner. A mail regarding nominations was sent out. As soon as the official nominations list was curated, the strategies to campaign for the elections began. The inboxes were filled with the manifestos of all the candidates. The election debate gave a much clear picture of the candidates and helped the students in getting their doubts regarding the elections clarified. The big day arrived. All the students on campus stood in the long queue to cast their votes in the soaking sultry weather. The results of the elections were declared that evening. The weather was cool as it was pouring, creating a cool atmosphere for the winning candidates to celebrate.

### **Conclusion**
Cheers to all those brains behind these events and to all those brainstorming sessions they had, to shape, and execute them this way. All the organisers got a pretty new experience of how things could be taken care of during such uncertain situations. Most of the students got to spend some real-time engineering life this year. It was quite a nice blend of things which allowed the students to explore their interests in life. In the past year, the campus got to witness new friendships forming and old friendships bidding farewell. Taking all these experiences into account, the organisers this year have set pretty high standards for their successors to work on.
