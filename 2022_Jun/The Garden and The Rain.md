<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">
The green bushes along the rocky path,<br>  
Bench among the tiny stretch of grass,<br>   
Trees at the edge of the wooden fence,<br>   
The pond is filled with water from the rains.<br> 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">
I see the butterfly hovering on flowers,<br> 
And the birds chirping from the leaves,<br>  
While the grasshoppers hop on the lawn,<br> 
And there is the harbinger of rain.<br>  
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">
Sitting on the bench, I watch the garden,<br>  
As I enjoy the serenity of the nature,<br>  
Who knew a storm was rising above,<br>  
Clouds turned dark, scaring away the dove.<br>  
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">
Lightning rolls through the clouds,<br>  
Breeze turns into strong winds,<br>  
Shaking the giant trees at the edges,<br>  
I run for a shelter from natureâ€™s rages.<br>  
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">
Then clouds burst and a downpour begins,<br>  
Turning the arranged garden into a mess,<br>  
Watching, I wonder, does it take time,<br>  
For the rocky dry path to turn to slime.<br>  
</p>
