Most of us are ignorant about the topic of Binary/Non-Binary Pronouns. This is not our fault. We are all brought up in a society that has a habit of viewing things as black or white. Now that we have come to accept the greyscale, it is our responsibility to understand its implications.

Pronouns are linguistic tools used instead of nouns. Our society has already been educated about the three widely used personal pronouns (He, She, and It). But today, our cultural visibility of gender has expanded and so have these pronouns. We must understand this expanded vocabulary and make use of it in our day-to-day life.

I had recently taken part in a debate where they asked us to mention our pronoun preferences. For an instant, I thought, isn't that obvious?, but later I realized it's not. As long as we don't mention our pronoun preference, how can we expect someone to get it right?

### How did Non-Binary pronouns come into existence?

We must understand that everyone has their pronoun preference. It is undeniable that the pronouns 'he' and 'she' come with certain expectations attached. Some feel these pronouns limit them from expressing themselves and it is true that conventional pronouns provide a binary identity to a non-binary individual. Thus arose the need to coin new words.

Some terms come from foreign languages, like the German-inspired "sie". Some from fiction. For example, "ze" and "per" are the pronouns inspired by the future utopia described by Marge Piercy in her feminist sci-fi novel, Woman on the Edge of Time.

While some are taken from the vast plant and animal kingdoms, others refer to relatable mythical beings. We have to be aware that these pronouns exist. Using the pronoun the person prefers implies we are respecting their identity. The best way to not mess up is to ask them their preferred pronoun.

The most common gender-neutral pronoun used is 'they/them/their.' 

### Gender-Inclusive Words

We all know English does not have a gender-neutral pronoun. Speakers/writers usually use the pronoun 'he/his' when referring to a generic individual. However, there were instances where people tried to rectify this.

In 1770, Robert Baker suggested using "one, ones" instead of "he, his".

In 1789, William H Marshall recorded the existence of the singular pronoun ou: 'Ou can' expresses either 'He can' 'She can' or 'It can'.

So, we should ensure our writings/speeches are inclusive of all people by not using any gender-specific pronouns/nouns.

### In Practice

Today, intending to respect one's identity, more and more companies ensure their employees are aware of their co-workers' preferred pronouns. They believe using correct gender pronouns helps safeguard an inclusive culture where all voices are given equitable power. Respecting someone's identification means using the gender pronouns with which they identify themselves.

Some people prefer more than one set of pronouns. How are we to know this if we don't ask individuals about their preferred pronoun(s)? It could be awkward at first. It would be better if we specify our preferred pronoun(s) before asking someone else's. If someone doesn't want to disclose their pronoun(s), we can refer to that person by their name only. But this goes two ways. We shouldn't take offense if someone doesn't get our pronoun(s) right the first few times. This is a whole new construct and getting used to it will definetly take some time. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

### Conclusion
Using someone's correct personal pronouns is a way of respecting them, just like using their name. It's advisable not to assume anyone's pronoun. If we presume wrong, there's a huge chance that it would be considered offensive. Keeping these points in mind, let's take a step forward in making everyone feel included and respected.
