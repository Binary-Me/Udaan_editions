Buses come and leave,  
Passengers board and alight,   
*Few* wait and some leave,  
All-day long, at the site,  
One sits with beliefs,  
A Bus that took his light,  
Took the rose, left the leaves,   
And thorns with blight,  
Waits for the bus of *thieves*,  
*Who* stole away all his delight.  


Some saw and perceived,   
An idler sitting in vain,  
Some blessed, few curses received,  
Still there sits, clothes with stains,  
A beggar, some believed,   
But he awaits hate's bane,  
With what everyone is weaved,  
He waits for a dream, as it rains,   
And the bus has arrived,  
While he falls for her again.
