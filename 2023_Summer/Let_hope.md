abio: "Neerav actually means silence in Sanskrit, and it maybe fair enough to call him a taciturn. 
A sophomore pursuing a BTech in Chemical Engineering at IIT Tirupati, he is known for being a committed lover, but the only twist being that his soulmate is football. Apart from being a Bayern Munich fanatic, he enjoys Hollywood, novels, chess and being a meat foodie. His weakness? Not being run by an open source algorithm."

### PRELUDE

Raj walked in, sliding the creaky door that led down the dimly lit hallway. His grandpa had been bedridden for quite some time now. Though he could speak, his body had worn down. He was no longer Mr. Mohan of DD News, a revered name in the media industry.                         
                                    
Raj watched with his eyelids rather heavy as his granny fed the old man porridge. He had never witnessed a silence this loud.                  
                                             
The old couple puzzled him at times. He was doomed with questions that made him ponder over another road of thought. 

***What made his granny keep up with the tiring circle of food, drugs, hospitals, and repeat? What kept the fire of commitment going?***            
                                          
*He could feel the pain in their eyes,*                
*An aroma of a long tale of love,*                  
*A super strong commitment,*                 
*…Maybe a red thread concept after all.*              

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">I want you to look right in my eyes<br>
To tell me you love me, to be by my side<br>
I want you at the end of my life<br>
I wanna see your face, when I fall with grace<br>
At the moment I die<br>
Is that alright?<br>
Is that alright?</p>       

The love story started way back in 1974, for it was a captivating tale spun with wasps and roses all along. In the streets of Pune, love had blossomed between Dr. Meera; an anatomist and a part-time starry-eyed romantic with a sense for noble love, and Mohan; a journalist, who covered the local news for DD. It was love at first sight. Within the tick of a clock, the relationship had bloomed, and the couple devised a plan which eventually worked out. Their parents were more than elated to get them married- which is how Mohan married Dr. Meera in 1976. Their marriage had been a blissful one; much to the joy of their families.                                     

*Until the storm arrived, knocking at their doorstep.*
****************************

### INTERLUDE
                 
It happened one twilight.                
On her way home from the clinic.                      
On a crowded bus.                               
She wasn't alone.                                
*A group of men had touched her. Groped her.*                    
*Unafraid. Unashamed.*                   
                       
She had jostled them away and yelled for help, but the other people on the bus had stayed silent, with pale, numb looks on their faces, trembling in helplessness. The men got off at the High Court stop. 
That’s when one of the old ladies sitting by the aisle had told Meera that those men were politicians with a powerful influence in the Shivajinagar area and the whole of Pune.                                   

So what mattered now was to keep quiet and let it die down.                                                      
Gulp the shame and ignore the injustice.                         
                       
But neither would Meera keep quiet nor would Mohan.                                                                     
Mohan had raged when he had come to know about it. He had used all his power and influence in the media world to let the world know about the crime that had been committed in broad daylight. An FIR had been filed against those men; those men who had the backing of  MLA Mr. Vikas.                                                                                     
It seemed as if their bond could never rust, and no MLA or any foreign power could itch their relationship. Mohan and Meera were seen as two very educated, liberal, and progressive thinkers, and their unorthodox approach was idolized in their friend circles, but not for long.                                                            
                     
Why?                                                     
Because it hadn’t taken long for Vikas to come to know about the journalist and his influence to rot him down. He was livid and rather flustered. His team quickly weaved out a plan to suppress Mohan. 
A few weeks later as Mohan drove his Ambassador down University Road, he saw a man bleeding to death with his cycle torn apart- right in front of a bar. Mohan quickly stopped by and rushed to call an ambulance.                                                                 
But what awaited him was unimaginable.                         
                         
A group of police vans handcuffed Mohan.                                                  
They testified that they had seen Mohan overspeed and knock down the driver right in front of their eyes.                                                        
Dumbfounded, agitated, and with his whole mind rather blurry, Mohan was speechless.                       
                         
He quickly realized that Vikas had something to do with the accident, and he must have bribed the bar owner to testify against Mohan as the sole witness, with a second brilliant bribe to puppet the police officers to lock him behind bars; so that the sexual harassment case could be bubbled and killed away.                               
                                     
The bicycle guy passed away within a few days, making the case more sinister and unsolvable.                                                                    
Even with a lawyer, there was nothing that could be done.                                              
The bar owner was the key and he wasn’t changing his testimony.                           
Mohan was sentenced to 10 years in prison.                                  
                  
<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br>
You and I drink the poison from the same vine<br>
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br>
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight<br>
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight…</p>

It was a sin to call them sinners, but the darkness covered it all. His grandparents’ love story was more than a plain romance, it was an emotion. Emotions and pain bled within Mohan and Meera, and seeing her husband sacrifice himself while trying to get justice for her brought her to her knees.                     
                                  
“Paralysis in the jail? You got it wrong!” Grandmother scoffed at Raj.                                  
                                            
“It was more than paralysis, it was suppression. We never gave up, it was a battle of love versus money, but the only difference was that they had everything to lose- money, fame, and votes, while we had nothing to lose; because our love would never lose- so we kept pushing.”                    
                                                           
Raj had never heard his grandfather speak about those days until today. His pupils widened, and he wanted to hear it all, from the man, Mohan himself. His eyes glossed, with a layer of tears. Meera gave him a gleaming stare- her eyes spoke well of her struggles when he was imprisoned. She remembered how she had fled to Mumbai to her sister’s place, just to get her mind straight amid all the bombs detonating one by one.                                   
                                      
Old Mohan’s eyes crinkled in the corners as they followed Meera, who kept staring at him.                     
                                    
His pearly eyes stared hard like all the secrets were right on her face.
Mohan cleared his throat.

### DRINKING TRAUMA

“I was sent to the 15th cell on the 4th block, in the Yerwada Prison. The first few weeks were hard to adjust to, and socializing with the other inmates was tough. Bribing, murder, robbery- the place was richly diverse, and I knew it would be a whole new voyage for quite some time.                
                                              
Months passed and I had become strangled by the ropes, with nothing to do. We were given tasks that got our minds distracted. My career seemed to be slaughtered, and all I did was smoke and think about my family staring at the stars every night, hoping that destiny had other plans.                 
          
Bailing didn’t seem facile anymore, and my lawyer was in total shambles, until one day when he sent me a letter.                                      

He wanted me to give it a last try, and do everything in my power to throw Vikas off the throne. He wanted DD to investigate the accident and the harassment case of Dr. Meera on its own so that public knowledge would throw the politicians under the bus.                     
                                 
I did as he told me.                                                    
I pleaded every single person I knew in the media to press into this issue and reveal the truth to the public so that there was some hope for justice.                                                                   
The next 2 months were disparate.                                         
**DD investigated if the Ambassador had hit the bicycle.**          
*The car was surprisingly untouched!*                                                              
**The bar owners were questioned. DD checked the records to find out if any other person was spotted that night, on University Road.**                                                 
*Someone had reported seeing people associated with MLA Vikas that day.*                                         
**DD lighted up the sexual harassment case on the bus, which coincidentally had happened just a few weeks before the accident.**                                
*The bus conductor and the other passengers were tracked and heavily questioned.*                  
                                     
I don’t know what went wrong, but it felt that the brain engineering this plan was smarter than we thought. As soon as they felt things were slipping out of their hand, they used all their influence to puppeteer jail authorities and the wardens.                                                                   
Ahem.                      
                
**Son, in chess, is there luck? None.**                                                     
**The queen is the money, its beauty helps it get unlimited power, and the influence is insane.**                                                              
**You are the king, caged with responsibilities, just moving one block at a time, towards life.**                                                                    
**The rooks, bishops, and knights are your family, but they become helpless once the queen finds her attack.**                                                         
**The pawns are your pieces of evidence, or your Plan B.**                                                                  
**Move them ahead slowly, save them till the end of the board, and let the diligence promote itself to the power of the queen.**                                                         
**And if you lose focus, there’s no coming back.**                                                            
**Take full responsibility. Keep hoping. Fingers crossed.**                                                    
**It’s the same with life.**                                     
                                                        
**But before our pawn reached the end of the board,  theirs did. They had 2 queens in action now.**                                 

Very soon there was a rumor which was sparked by the wardens.            
                     
*The prisoner in cell 15, block 4, Mr. Mohan is mentally unstable. Any such behavior if observed should be reported.*                
                           
A fake medical certificate was issued. I had been diagnosed with PTSD  and Bipolar disorder a few months ago. This was ruinous.                 
             
Life sunk into grayscale.                
                 
Since the jail authorities didn’t have any power to put me in a mental asylum using a fake medical report, they wanted my inmates to observe such behavior and use them as witnesses to kick me out of the equation.
DD reports all died down, as Vikas engineered another plan to book a money laundering case on the chief editor, to take him down.                
                         
Meera went into depression, left her job, and couldn’t take it anymore. She was too afraid to speak. Death threats were becoming too common.          
        
<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Hey what's up, it's been a while<br>
Talking 'bout it's not my style<br>
Thought I'd see what's up<br>
While I'm lighting up<br>
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted</p>
             
Indeed cold-hearted. The old man took a deep breath but still started with a sense of radical vanity.                                 
“Son, if you ride like lightning, you are going to crash like thunder- remember that.                                     
The next few months were the ones that made me like this.                   
*I could barely breathe. I lost privacy, I lost my confidence and I lost all the bonds with my inmates.*                                     
*I could feel eyes staring at me every moment.*                                         
*I washed the plates, and the person beside me would check on me.*                         
*I couldn’t daydream. I couldn’t keep quiet. Dozens of my mates would come to check on me.*                                      
If I protested angrily, they would look at me, more focused.                 
They would look at each other, giving a self-assured look, and would shake their heads in disdain.                                                   
This took nearly one month to buildup, but this was the scariest part I have ever been through in my life.    
                                                                                   
I was already mentally disturbed by the series of events and couldn’t take it anymore - timing sucks, bitch.                  

***I was being treated as someone special.***                            
***I couldn’t complain anymore about the food- mental instability.***                             
***But I couldn’t be happy with the terrible food either- again mental instability.***                                  
***I lost my right to shout or become angry- mentally depressed.***                   
***I lost my right to cry- mentally weak.***                         
***I lost my right to laugh at the wrong times- mentally challenged.***             
***They all noted every single point to check if I was mental indeed.***                        
***I was slowly building up a rivalry with my mind, trying to act all normal with eyes staring at me left and right.***                             
***I lost the best friends I made there and the trust dissolved.***                           
***In front of their eyes, I was already a mental patient.***                   

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'<br>
How do I know if this shit's fabricated?<br>
Time goes by and I can't control my mind<br>
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time<br>
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'<br>
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'</p>

“But I couldn’t keep breathing for long.                         
Within a few months, the notice arrived. I was going to be transferred to the nearby Kirkee Mental Asylum. A few inmates who claimed to have witnessed symptoms of mental instability in me had ratted me out.                 
                    
I didn’t know how to respond to that.                              
The wardens who were the MLA’s puppets raced the process, and the bribe catalyzed it further.                        
Within a month,  I was transferred to the asylum through a fake medical report issued by the jail committee, which was controlled by Vikas and his cronies. They would do anything to push me down.                
But I had no idea what was coming next.                
They weren’t done.                       

In the mental ward, I had a psychiatrist in charge of the tests and the medication.                 
I was involuntarily committed, and I had no right to discharge myself without the doc's consent.                     
It all seemed bleak, and indeed it was.                       

My case was severe; that’s what the bribed doctors said. 
**They spoke of terms like Shock treatment with the ECT procedure, which freaked my nerves out, but sadly it ended up being just that.**               
**So ECT was the only option; Vikas wanted it to be that way.**              

If there was one person in the room who knew how deadly corruption was, it was my psychiatrist.                  
I remember that look- wrinkles filling his forehead and his eyebrows rather frowning- the guilt of helplessness caging him.                   
Don't expect life to be fair, and in my case, cruelty shadowed every good deed I had ever done.                
                   
*The first thing I remember after that was fighting with a bunch of doctors who dragged me to the ECT room. I was helpless and I felt more than powerless.*                                             
*The technicians beat me with sticks, strapped me on the bed using ropes, and showed no mercy.*                    
*I tried my best to break free, maladroitly.*                   
*They stuck the electrodes on my scalp and pushed in a mouth guard. I tried biting, scratching, and pinching but it was all in vain.*                     
*They were paid so much that they didn’t even care to use anesthesia before the ECT. The last thing I remembered was feeling a heavy jerk hit my body.*                   
*My jaws cracked against the mouth guard, and I could feel my saliva flooding against my cheeks.*
*Very soon I was out.*                    
               
**The next thing I remember was waking up, with a nauseated feeling.**
**A week had passed.**             
**My head was heavy.**                   
**It was all cloudy in my head, and my jaw ached bad.**                 
**I was no longer strapped to the bed, but I couldn’t move a single bone.**                         
**My neck ached. I could barely hear my voice when I tried pushing some air into my cords.**                     
**I could feel dried saliva on my cheeks.**               
**My temples kept throbbing for no reason, and it felt as if the juices in my brain would explode any second.**                  
**I could feel how dark my eyes had become, without looking into myself in the mirror.**               
**This wasn’t any ECT.**                     
**This was the definition of human torture.**

I couldn’t trust my ears anymore. I could feel my blood gush in my ear, and the story freaked me out. 
My heart was thrashing against my chest.

He continued,                                
“Over the next several years I was taken to the rehabilitation center. My locomotion and my muscles improved, but my memory remained foggy.                       
I barely spoke to anyone.                  
I didn't think about the past. I didn't want to.                              
Did I regret my actions? Even today, that would be a rhetorical question for me.                                         
Meera was almost mentally wrecked, and the weekly letters we used to send each other were the only loose pieces of hope left in our lives.                     
After 2 years, I was released from the asylum. I went back and met all of my people, and people just gave me the most pensive look which made me feel even worse about myself.                    
But your grandmother, she was the only one whose eyes didn’t show pain but flooded with tears of joy which made me think I should have got her a flower at least.                    
Par unko kya phool du woh khud koi gulaab se kam nahi!                    
I wanted to start a new life with a singular hunger to satisfy my lover’s every single need.                                      

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Past lives couldn't ever hold me down<br>
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found<br>
I've got the strangest feeling<br>
This isn't our first time around<br>
Past lives couldn't ever come between us<br>
Some time the dreamers finally wake up<br>
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming<br>
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming….</p>

“Maybe justice took a different route.              
Maybe the bad guys and their power won.                 
Maybe the money tore me and my career apart.                       
Maybe Vikas did us dirty and ruined even my wife’s dreams.                   
But one thing money and power couldn’t beat was the love we had for each other because love is the only pain you wanna feel once in a lifetime.                          
They cracked before our bond, which became stronger and stronger every day, and this love is what made us restart our life right from scratch, climbing the ladder step by step again, and here you are, Raj, listening to me.”                    

I could still feel the agony in their eyes.                 
And the love drug whistling around, still ever potent, like before.
